HasGeek App Boilerplate
=======================

![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hasgeek/hgapp.svg)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/hasgeek/hgapp/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/hasgeek/hgapp)

Base template for an app that uses Lastuser, Baseframe and Coaster with Flask
and SQLAlchemy. To use this, clone this repository and rename all references
to "hgapp" with the name of your new app.

This boilerplate uses Compass for custom stylesheets. Stylesheets are located
in `hgapp/static/sass` and may be rebuilt with `compass compile`. To rebuild
automatically, use `compass watch`.
